On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 1d10} bludgeoning damage and is knocked {@condition prone} as well as pushed 5 feet in the direction the log is travelling. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked {@condition prone} or pushed. The log then crumbles into nothing."
